These scripts are powerful, but written in a becoming-increasingly-rare language, and so I've forked this repo to start working on translating these scripts to a new language, like PowerShell.
I may also consider using bits or pieces of this to give me something to work on in Python or Go, as I want (need?) to skill up in those languages.
